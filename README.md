# Campus Pulse Initiative

## Overview

Campus Pulse Initiative is a data-driven project designed to analyze and predict student engagement and performance using machine learning techniques. The workflow leverages popular Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and model interpretation.

## Software Used

- **Python**: 3.11.12  
- **NumPy**: 2.0.2  
- **Pandas**: 2.2.2  
- **Matplotlib**: 3.10.0  
- **Seaborn**: 0.13.2  
- **Scikit-learn**: 1.6.1  
- **SHAP**: 0.47.2

## Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Preprocessing

- **Description:**  
  The workflow begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the data for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Description:**  
  Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and to identify patterns or anomalies in the data.

### 3. Feature Selection

- **Description:**  
  Relevant features are selected based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

### 4. Model Building

- **Description:**  
  Machine learning models are built using Scikit-learn. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various algorithms (such as classification or regression models) are trained and evaluated.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Description:**  
  Model performance is assessed using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC). Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize results.

### 6. Model Interpretation

- **Description:**  
  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of each feature on the output.

### 7. Results and Insights

- **Description:**  
  The final section summarizes the key findings, model performance, and actionable insights derived from the analysis.
